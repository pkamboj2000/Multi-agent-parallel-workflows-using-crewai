       "- **Interior Tech**: Features a 7-inch digital gauge cluster, 9-inch infotainment system with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and Honda’s new Smart Device Link app for enhanced connectivity. \n",
       "- **Fuel Efficiency**: EPA-estimated 30 mpg city/38 mpg highway for the 2.0L model and 32/42 mpg for the turbocharged 1.5L, making it one of the most efficient in its class. \n",
       "- **Driving Experience**: Agile handling, precise steering, and a refined ride, though the 1.5T’s lower weight improves agility over the 2.0L model. \n",

       "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to combine the three reviews into a concise summary with specific bullets, a verdict, and agreement/differences sections. First, I'll go through each review to extract the key points.\n",
       "\n",
       "Review 1 (Edmunds) mentions engine options, interior tech, fuel efficiency, driving experience, and value. They recommend the 1.5T model. Review 2 (Car & Driver) talks about improved fuel efficiency, updated tech, refined ride, comfortable interior, and standard safety. Review 3 (Top Gear) highlights driving dynamics, interior tech, efficient engines including hybrid, pricing, and safety.\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking for consensus points. All three mention fuel efficiency improvements. Tech features like Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are common. Driving dynamics and handling are praised by all. Safety tech is standard across the board. The 1.5L turbo engine is recommended by Edmunds, but others don't specify. Car & Driver and Top Gear mention interior materials lagging and hybrid options, which are differences.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, the bullets need to be 4-6 without duplicates. Let's see: Fuel efficiency across all models, tech features with infotainment systems, driving dynamics, standard safety tech, and competitive pricing. That's five bullets. \n",

       "For the verdict, it should highlight the Civic's strengths in efficiency, tech, handling, and value, while noting the interior materials and engine recommendations. \n",

       "Agreement is on fuel efficiency, tech, handling, and safety. Differences are in interior materials vs. others, and engine preference (Edmunds vs. others). \n",

       "Need to make sure the verdict is concise and covers all points without being redundant. Also check for any missed details like hybrid in Review 3. Maybe include that in the differences under engine options. \n",

       "Double-check the links to ensure accuracy, but the user didn't ask for them in the final answer. Focus on the content. Make sure the bullets are specific and not overlapping.

       "- **Tech Features:** Standard Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, a user-friendly infotainment system (7–10.2-inch screens depending on trim), and Honda’s Smart Device Link app enhance connectivity.  \n",

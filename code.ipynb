       "Okay, let's tackle this. I need to combine the three reviews into a concise summary with specific bullets, a verdict, and sections on where they agree and differ. First, I'll go through each review's pros and cons to identify common points.\n",
       "\n",
       "Review 1 (Edmunds) mentions the 1.5L turbo engine with improved fuel efficiency (32/42 mpg), a 12.3-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, all-wheel drive availability, Honda Sensing 3.0 safety tech, and a premium interior. Cons include no wireless charging on base models, firm suspension, limited rear legroom, laggy infotainment, and modest cargo space.\n",
       "\n",
       "Review 2 (Car & Driver) highlights the same engine and fuel efficiency, a 10.2-inch touchscreen. Cons are missing Apple CarPlay and automatic emergency braking on base models, and firm suspension. They note entry-level trims are under-equipped.\n",
       "\n",
       "Review 3 (Top Gear) talks about the 1.5T engine's responsiveness and efficiency, updated interior with new infotainment but creaky plastics, agile handling, firm ride, hybrid variant's mpg, and optional tech packages adding cost. Verdict mentions dynamics and efficiency but interior build quality lags.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, for consensus bullets. The engine and fuel efficiency are mentioned in all three. All agree on the firm suspension. The interior tech is a pro in all but with some cons like lag or creaky plastics. Handling/agility is a pro in Top Gear and Edmunds mentions all-wheel drive. Cargo space and rear legroom are cons in Edmunds and Car & Driver. Optional features adding cost is in Top Gear and Edmunds mentions base models lacking some features.\n",
       "\n",
       "Verdict needs to balance the positives like performance, efficiency, tech, and handling, while noting the cons like base model features, interior build, and space. \n",
       "\n",
       "Agreement points: All agree on the engine's efficiency and firm ride. They also agree on the interior tech having issues. Differences: Edmunds and Car & Driver mention base models lacking features, while Top Gear talks about optional packages. Edmunds and Car & Driver note space issues, Top Gear mentions hybrid variant. \n",
       "\n",
       "Need to make sure bullets are unique and not duplicated. Let me check each point again. Engine and fuel efficiency are common. Suspension firmness is in all. Interior tech pros and cons. Handling is in two reviews. Cargo space and rear legroom in two. Optional features in one. \n",
       "\n",
       "Now, structure the bullets into 4-6 points. Maybe:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. 1.5L turbo engine with 32/42 mpg.\n",
       "2. Updated infotainment (sizes vary) with some lag or creaky plastics.\n",
       "3. Agile handling and precise steering, but firm ride.\n",
       "4. Base models lack wireless charging, Apple CarPlay, and safety features; optional packages add cost.\n",
       "5. Limited rear legroom and modest cargo space (15.1 cu ft).\n",
       "\n",
       "Verdict: The 2024 Civic is a strong compact with good efficiency and handling, but base models are under-equipped and interior build quality is mixed. \n",

       "- **Updated infotainment system** (10.2â€“12.3-inch touchscreen) includes Apple CarPlay/Android Auto but suffers from occasional lag or creaky plastics.  \n",

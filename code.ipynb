       "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to combine three reviews of the 2024 Honda Civic into a concise summary with specific sections. First, I need to extract the key points from each review.\n",
       "\n",
       "Starting with Edmunds: Pros include sporty design, responsive handling, fuel efficiency (32 mpg), 10.2-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay, and safety features. Cons are firm ride, basic infotainment, and cramped back seat. Their verdict highlights efficiency and fun but sacrifices comfort.\n",
       "\n",
       "Car & Driver mentions the 1.5T engine with 182 hp, sharp handling, tech features, fuel efficiency (32/40 mpg), and a quiet cabin. Cons are firm ride, limited rear legroom, no sunroof, turbo lag in 2.0T, and missing driver-assist in base models. Their verdict says it's well-rounded but needs higher trims for premium features.\n",
       "\n",
       "Top Gear points out sharp handling, updated interior with new infotainment, efficient engine with 10-speed auto, improved ride comfort, and safety. Cons are cheaper plastics, limited rear legroom in higher trims, and pricey optional tech. Their verdict says it's compelling with a sporty edge but lags in interior refinement compared to Golf.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now, I need to create 4-6 consensus bullets. Let's see what's common across all three. All mention sporty handling, fuel efficiency (around 32 mpg combined or city), tech features like Apple CarPlay, and rear legroom issues. Also, firm ride quality is a common con. Safety features are mentioned by Edmunds and Top Gear.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the verdict paragraph, it should encapsulate the main positives and negatives. Emphasize the sporty, efficient, tech features, but note the trade-offs in comfort and interior quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "Agreement points: All agree on handling, fuel efficiency, tech, rear legroom, and firm ride. Differences: Edmunds and Car & Driver mention base model shortcomings, while Top Gear compares to Golf. Also, Edmunds and Car & Driver note specific engine issues (turbo lag in 2.0T, base model lacks features), while Top Gear talks about interior plastics and optional tech pricing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Need to make sure bullets are concise and non-redundant. Check for duplicates. For example, fuel efficiency is mentioned in all three, so that's a consensus. Handling is another. Rear legroom is a common con. Tech features like Apple CarPlay are across all. Safety features are in two reviews but maybe not all three, but since two mention it, maybe include as consensus. Wait, Edmunds and Top Gear mention safety, Car & Driver mentions driver-assist features as missing in base models. So safety features are present but maybe not standard across all trims. Hmm. Maybe consensus on comprehensive safety features.\n",
       "\n",
       "Need to verify each point. Let me list all the pros and cons from each review and cross-reference.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pros Consensus:\n",
       "- Sporty handling/ agile driving dynamics (all three)\n",
       "- Fuel-efficient (32 mpg combined or similar)\n",
       "- Tech features (Apple CarPlay, touchscreen)\n",
       "- Safety features (Edmunds, Top Gear)\n",
       "- Improved ride comfort (Top Gear mentions improved, but others mention firm ride. Wait, that's conflicting. Wait, Top Gear says improved ride comfort, but Edmunds and Car & Driver mention firm ride. So maybe not consensus. Hmm. Wait, the consensus bullets need to be points all agree on. So maybe not ride comfort. Let me check again.\n",
       "\n",
       "Wait, Edmunds says firm ride on rough roads, Car & Driver says firm ride quality on base models, Top Gear says improved ride comfort. So actually, they differ on ride quality. So that's a difference. So consensus bullets can't include ride comfort. So consensus pros are handling, fuel efficiency, tech features, and rear legroom issues as a con. Wait, all three mention rear legroom as a con. So that's a consensus con.\n",
